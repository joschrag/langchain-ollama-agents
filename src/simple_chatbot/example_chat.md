Your input: What is tan(x)?
    The tangent function (tan(x)) in trigonometry is the ratio of the sine and cosine functions, or more specifically:
    tan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x)
    where x represents an angle in radians.
Your input: What is its inverse?
    Your question seems incomplete. Could you provide more context or specify the function/operation you're referring to, so I can help you find its inverse?
